# ManFight
Two classes Man and ManFight that together make a fun little text game

This was made to amuse my non-techie husband and make him pay attention to my explanation of the code, 
I managed to get his attention for a minute so, win.  I am just a beginner, part way through Tim Bulchalka's course, https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/, so be kind.
